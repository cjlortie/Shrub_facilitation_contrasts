# shrub.contrasts
A contrast of the specificity of shrub species effects within the San Joaquin Desert region.

Panoche Hills Ecological Reserve and Mojave National Preserve were sampled to contrast the positive effects of two different shrub species on other plant species within each landscape.  Primary and derived data are provided.

The hypothesis tested is that positive effects are species specific.
Ephedra californica effects are contrasted to Larrea tridentata.
