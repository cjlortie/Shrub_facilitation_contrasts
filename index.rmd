###A contrast of benefactor plant specificity
The hypothesis tested is that foundation shrub positive effects are species specific.
*Ephedra californica* effects are contrasted to those of *Larrea tridentata* in two different desert sites at the upper and lower extents of the San Joaquin Desert Region.

###Data & meta-data
Panoche sites = 1.1 is plateau, 1.2 is south, 1.3 is north. The plateau is approx 5 km^2 and sites 1.2 and 1.3 are 1 acre. Extensive manipulative research including shrub removals and mimics done at Panoche site 1.1, the plateau.  

Mojave sites = a total of five sites with each on Kelbaker Road corresponding to increasing elevations of 313, 515, 737,951, & 1128m.
